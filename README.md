# minecraft-again
yeah I made it again

Minecraft, but it's built on top of a deferred renderer.

Use the `Makefile` (`$ make`) to build.

PLEASE NOTE, this is just some reference code - I will not be supporting it, adding new platforms, fixing bugs, or anything like that - but feel free to browse :)
